Programming Challenge 2:

1) Reverse of a string without reverse method.
2) Find a palindrome
2)Â Please create a class for the below and send it,

We have a table which has 4 columns as id, name, phone and address.
You need to have a method which will return me the data.
Create a method where you can hard code the data and print the details.
The main aim of above example is how you use data structure.

The project contains 3 java files
1. StringUtils.java
   String reverse(String strInput): for reversing the input string
   isPalendrome(String strInput): for checking if the input string is palindrome
2. Record.java
   This class is a data structure to store the objects(records) containing the table data(id,name,phone,address).
   Here the assumption is that the id is the primary key.
3. Table.java
   getAllRecords(): for retriving all records
   add(int id, String name, String phone, String address): for adding the record into table and printing the record.
